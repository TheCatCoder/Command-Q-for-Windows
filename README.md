# Command-Q-for-Windows
Makes Alt + Q do the same thing as Command + Q on a Mac

If you just came here and you're wondering what the Windows equivelant keyboard shortcut is for Command + Q, the answer is Alt + F4. However, I grew up on a mac and this is the one command that is far more awkward on Windows than on Mac. So I created this AutoHotKey script that simply grabs the name of your current window and closes it using a AHK command. It doesn't simply map Alt + Q to Alt + F4. It is very simple though and if you have AHK already installed on your computer, you can just copy and paste the bottom part of my script into one of yours. You can also download the exe equivelent if you don't have AHK installed on your computer. Look in the code folder for both of those things.
